# Marketing-research
Market research of food service businesses in L.A.
- This project's aim was to assist decision makers regarding the opening of a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles, by preparing market research. 
- The analysis provided a clear picture of the current market conditions- specifically: The distribution of foodservice shops across different types of foodservices, as well as across different streets in the city. 
- Also, it included the distribution of chain and non-chain shops, and the number of seats in each establishment. 
- Relevant data was extracted from open-source data on restaurants in LA.

- Research included 2 stages:

  - Preprocessing data (dealing with missing values, looking for duplicates and changing data types).
  - Data analysis: focusing on the distribution of shops and number of seats, across different streets, foodservice type and comparing chains to non-chain shops.
